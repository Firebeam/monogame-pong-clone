# MonoGame Pong Clone

Super basic Pong clone, based on a Pluralsight course (it's closed, sorry). 
However, I found the course itself was a bit outdated so I decided to learn using the latest MonoGame version available, 3.6. 
The Pipeline tool is more or less stable by now so it should work with even less steps than usual.

This is my lame attempt to get everything working, and I wanted to learn, so.
